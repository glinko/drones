### Database Schema
The database schema is complete and includes all required tables:
- Users with role-based access
- Projects with ownership and membership
- Media with metadata and ordering
- Invitations with token-based access
- Audit logs for security tracking

### Authentication Flow

2. User logs in → JWT token stored in httpOnly cookie
3. Middleware protects routes based on role
4. Password reset via email tokens

### Security Considerations
- JWT tokens with httpOnly cookies
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Email verification for new accounts
- Role-based access control
- Route protection middleware
